# Online_Electronics_Retail_Database

An offline electronics retail store wishes to take its business on an online platform. To facilitate this, I have created an Entity-Relationship diagram. I further converted this to a Logical model using cardinalities by understanding the business. After normalizing the table, I populated it with dummy data. I later connected this database in python and performed some basic visualizations. I also connected this database to MongoDb.
